Context
"This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset
is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset.
Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females
at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage."
Content
"The datasets consists of several medical predictor variables and one target variable, Outcome. Predictor variables includes the
number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age, and so on.
