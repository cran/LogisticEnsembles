## First release

* Added South Africa heart data as a great example!

* Added a lot of new plots to help the user choose the best possible model (or avoid models that are not good):
1. Negative predictive value (free scales)
2. Negative predictive value (fixed scales)
3. Positive predictive value (free scales)
4. Positive predictive value (fixed scales)
5. F1 score, free scales
6. F1 score, fixed scales
7. False negative rate (free scales)
8. False negative rate (fixed scales)
9. False positive rate (free scales)
10. False positive rate (fixed scales)
11. True negative rate (free scales)
12. True negative rate (fixed scales)
13. True positive rate (free scales)
14. True positive rate (fixed scales)
15. Overfitting (fixed scales)
16. Variance Inflation Factor (below a level set by the user)
