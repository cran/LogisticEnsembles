#' Context
#' "This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset
#' is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset.
#' Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females
#' at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage."
#' Content
#' "The datasets consists of several medical predictor variables and one target variable, Outcome. Predictor variables includes the
#' number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age, and so on.
